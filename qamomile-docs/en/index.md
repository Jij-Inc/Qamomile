# Welcome to Qamomile

Qamomile is a powerful SDK designed for quantum optimization algorithms, specializing in the conversion of mathematical models into quantum circuits. It serves as a bridge between classical optimization problems and quantum computing solutions.

## Key Features

- **Versatile Compatibility**: Supports leading quantum circuit SDKs including Qiskit and Quri-parts.
- **Advanced Algorithm Support**: Goes beyond QAOA to include sophisticated encoding and algorithms like QRAO.
- **Flexible Model Conversion**: Utilizes JijModeling for describing mathematical models and converting them to various quantum circuit SDKs.
- **Intermediate Representation**: Capable of representing both Hamiltonians and quantum circuits as intermediate forms.
- **Standalone Functionality**: Can implement quantum circuits independently, similar to other quantum circuit SDKs.

## Quick Start

To get started with Qamomile, follow these simple steps:

1. Install Qamomile:
   ```
   pip install qamomile
   ```

2. Import the necessary modules:
   ```python
   from qamomile import QamomileModel, QAOACircuit
   ```

3. Create your quantum optimization model:
   ```python
   model = QamomileModel()
   # Define your optimization problem here
   ```

4. Generate a quantum circuit:
   ```python
   circuit = QAOACircuit(model)
   ```

5. Run your quantum optimization algorithm:
   ```python
   result = circuit.run()
   ```
