"""Inject Google Colab launcher script into built documentation HTML.

Also rewrites the build-dir scratch path out of any GitHub edit / blob
URLs that mystmd embedded in the build output. Because ``./build.sh
build`` runs mystmd from ``docs/_build_src/<lang>/`` (so the committed
source tree never receives auto-managed injections), mystmd derives
the project-relative source path as
``docs/_build_src/<lang>/<section>/<slug>.ipynb`` and bakes that into
the "Edit on GitHub" / "View source" anchors **in both the HTML page
header and the per-page JSON data layer**. Those URLs would 404 on
``main`` because ``_build_src/`` is gitignored, and they would also
cause ``colab-launch.js`` to fail its ``^docs/(en|ja)/`` path check
and silently drop the Colab button — most visibly on SPA navigation,
where the page header re-hydrates from the JSON data layer. We
therefore rewrite the URLs back to their canonical ``docs/<lang>/...``
form across both file types after mystmd's output has been copied
into ``docs/<lang>/_build/html/``.

    segment so the "Edit on GitHub" / "View source" links resolve, and so
    ``colab-launch.js``'s ``^docs/(en|ja)/`` path check accepts the
    embedded edit URL and renders the Colab button.

    Patching only the HTML pages would leave the JSON data layer stale: a
    full page load would pick up the rewritten HTML, but as soon as the
    SPA navigated to another page it would re-hydrate the page header from
    the JSON and re-introduce the ``_build_src/`` URL — so the Colab
    button would silently disappear after the first navigation. The
    caller therefore runs this on the union of ``*.html`` and ``*.json``.
