    "This release mayjorly encences the accessibility for broader people by adding some [tutorials in Japanese](https://jij-inc.github.io/Qamomile/ja/), usability by supporting [OMMX v2](https://jij-inc.github.io/ommx/en/introduction.html) and introducing a new target quantum SDK, [CUDA-Q](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-q), as well as [Bloqade-Analog](https://github.com/QuEraComputing/bloqade-analog). We believe that, especially OMMX v2 support is a big step for us and users as OMMX allows us to compare quantum optimisation algorithms and classical solvers esaier than before as OMMX provides us the united form of optimisation problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have other updates having slightly smaller impacts as well. Please have a look at our [releases](https://github.com/Jij-Inc/Qamomile/releases) and individual PRs for more details."
