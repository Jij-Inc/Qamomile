# Welcome to Qamomile

Qamomile is a powerful SDK designed for quantum optimization algorithms, specializing in the conversion of mathematical models into quantum circuits. It serves as a bridge between classical optimization problems and quantum computing solutions.

## Key Features

- **Versatile Compatibility**: Supports leading quantum circuit SDKs including Qiskit and Quri-parts.
- **Advanced Algorithm Support**: Goes beyond QAOA to include sophisticated encoding and algorithms like QRAO.
- **Flexible Model Conversion**: Utilizes JijModeling for describing mathematical models and converting them to various quantum circuit SDKs.
- **Intermediate Representation**: Capable of representing both Hamiltonians and quantum circuits as intermediate forms.
- **Standalone Functionality**: Can implement quantum circuits independently, similar to other quantum circuit SDKs.
