# Qamomile Tutorial

Welcome to the Qamomile tutorial! This guide will help you get started with Qamomile, a powerful SDK designed for quantum optimization algorithms. Qamomile specializes in the conversion of mathematical models into quantum circuits, serving as a bridge between classical optimization problems and quantum computing solutions.

## Supported Quantum Optimization Encodings and Algorithms

- **QAOA**: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
- **QRAO**: Quantum Random Approximation Optimization


## Supported Quantum Circuit SDKs

- **Qiskit**
- **Quri-parts**
