## Style Guidelines

- Use clear, concise language.
- Follow the existing documentation structure and formatting.
- Include code examples where appropriate, especially when explaining qamomile's features or API.
- Use proper Markdown syntax for headings, lists, code blocks, etc.
- When documenting code, follow the docstring style used in the qamomile project.

## Documentation Structure

Our documentation is organized as follows:

- `index.md`: The main landing page
- `quickstart.md`: Guide for new users
- `api/`: API reference documentation for qamomile.
- `tutorial/`: Usage examples and tutorials
- `contribute.md`: This guide

Feel free to suggest improvements to this structure if you think it can be made more intuitive.
